# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations. The primary tool used is a Jupyter Notebook that processes and analyzes data from `INNHotelsGroup.csv`, a dataset containing booking information. The goal is to create a predictive model to assist hotel management in anticipating cancellations.

## Dataset
The dataset `INNHotelsGroup.csv` includes various details about hotel bookings, such as arrival dates, customer types, booking details, and whether the booking was canceled.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib (The notebook will detail the installation)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your system.
3. Install the required Python libraries mentioned above.
4. Open the `Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the data analysis and model building process.
