Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations. The primary tool used is a Jupyter Notebook that processes and analyzes data from INNHotelsGroup.csv, a dataset containing booking information. The goal is to create a predictive model to assist hotel management in anticipating cancellations.

Dataset
The dataset INNHotelsGroup.csv includes various details about hotel bookings, such as arrival dates, customer types, booking details, and whether the booking was canceled.
